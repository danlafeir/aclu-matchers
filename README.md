Following Donald Trump's executive order banning all refugees and citizens of 7 Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, many have offered to match donations to the ACLU up to a certain cap.

To my knowledge, there is no tool to track those who are actively matching (have volunteered, and have not yet hit their caps) I'd like to change that.  I am hoping to create a small webapp that displays Active Matchers.  I define Active Matchers as those who have volunteered to match donations, and have not yet hit their donation cap.

Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/), hosted on Github Pages [here](https://lukebelliveau.github.io/aclu-matchers/). Working with a bunch of tech I've never used before - just tinkering around!
