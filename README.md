Following Donald Trump's executive order banning all refugees and citizens of 7 Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, many have offered to match others' donations to the ACLU.

To my knowledge, there is no tool to track those who are actively matching and make it easy to share your receipts with matchers. I'd like to change that.

This application will allow you to drag-and-drop your receipt, which will automatically be shared with at least ten people who
are matching donations.
